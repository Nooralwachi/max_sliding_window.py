# max_sliding_window.py

Given a large array of integers and a window of size w, find the current maximum value in the window as the window slides through the entire array.
 
Example:

Letâ€™s try to find all maximums for a window size equal to 3 in the array given below:

[-4, 2, -5, 3, 6]

Step 1: For the first 3 elements in the window [-4,2,-5], max is 2

Step 2: Slide window one position to the right [2,-5,3], max is 3

Step 3: In the last window [-5,3,6], max is 6
